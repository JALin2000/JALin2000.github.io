## About Me

Hi! I am Junan, a PhD student under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Goulart](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~engs1373/) and [Prof. Luca Furieri](https://www.lucafurieri.it/) in the University of Oxford. I previously finished my master study in Robotics, Systems and Control program in ETH Zürich in 2025, and my bachelor study in Beihang University in 2022.

My main research interest is to incorporate **machine learning** techniques in **control schemes** to make them more adaptive, secure, and computationally efficient. My master thesis focused on efficiently learning value functions for constrained LQR using differentiable optimization.

In my leisure time, I like travelling by driving (have already driven more than 12,000 km), swimming and singing.

## Research Interests

- **System Control:** optimization theory, model predictive control, reinforcement learning
- **Applied Machine Learning:** object detection, action recognition, time series forecasting

## News
- **[May. 2025]** I start another part-time internship in ABB Schweiz! This time I focus on reinforcement learning for automatic operation on container ship.
- **[May. 2025]** I finish my master thesis titled "Data-Driven Terminal Cost Approximation for Short-Horizon Linear Quadratic MPC" in IfA in ETH Zürich, and obtain my master's degree! A big thank you to Dr. Efe Balta, Riccardo Zuliani and Prof. John Lygeros for your generous guidance along my project!
- **[Aug. 2024]** My internship paper "Enhancing Port Automation: A Novel Object Detection Pipeline for Container Ship Bays" is accepted by 2024 IEEE Sensors Conference! Thanks for those who helped and guided me through the way!
- **[Oct. 2023]** I start my 6-month internship as a 3D mapping intern in ABB Schweiz!
