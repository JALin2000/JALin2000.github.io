## About Me

Hi! I am a master student in Robotics, Systems and Control program in ETH Zürich, and I previously finished my bachelor study in Beihang University.

My main research interest is to incorporate **machine learning** techniques in **model-based control schemes** to make them more adaptive, secure, and computationally efficient. Now I am working on my master thesis, which focuses on approximating infinite horizon optimal control with short-horizon MPC in an efficient way, and I really like this topic! 

In my leisure time, I like working out, travelling by driving, swimming and singing.

## Research Interests

- **System Control:** optimization theory, model predictive control, reinforcement learning
- **Applied Machine Learning:** object detection, action recognition, time series forecasting
