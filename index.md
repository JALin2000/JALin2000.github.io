## About Me

Hi! I am a master student in Robotics, Systems and Control program in ETH Zürich, and I previously finished my bachelor study in Beihang University. My research interests include system control and machine learning. Now I am going to work on my master thesis, which incoporates these two things in an MPC framework to for better performance, and I really like this topic! In my leisure time, I like working out, travelling by driving, swimming and singing.

## Research Interests

- **System Control:** model predictive control, learning-based control
- **Machine Learning:** object detection, action recognition, time series forecasting
